					Creative imitation: “Hit them where they ain’t”
					Instead of designing something brand new, try to exploit potential opportunities of someone else’s innovation – but who have failed to exploit the opportunity to date. The teenage son of a friend of mine takes apps designed for Apple and converts them into apps for the Android – and makes a fortune. I am not debating the morality (or even legality) of this, but it is an example of this type of strategy.

					Creative imitation: entrepreneurial judo
					Here the entrepreneur tries to succeed in a market which someone has created but for some reason is not concerned about. The two examples used are where an organisation develops a product but does not capitalise on it through arrogance; or where an organisations simply picks out the high profit sector of the market and leaves the rest. Many companies operating at the “bottom of the pyramid” (such as mobile phones in Nigeria) are operating here and finding ways to make money and provide a valuable service.

					Finding and occupying a specialised “ecological niche”
This is where a company obtains a practical monopoly in a small area that, in itself, does not offer much incentives for others to compete in, as it is too small and/or requires highly specialist skills. An example is an Israeli company (Givun Imaging) that makes ingestible video cameras (fits into a pill) and allows Doctors to see the inside of the intestine of their patients.
